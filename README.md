## Business Problem
3-month item-level sales forecast for different stores.

There are 10 different stores and 50 different items in a 5-year dataset.

Accordingly, we need to give forecasts for 3 months after the store-item breakdown.

## Variables

date – Date of sales data
There are no holiday effects or store closures.

Store – Store ID
Unique number for each store.

Item - Item ID
Unique number for each product.

Sales – Number of products sold,
The number of products sold from a particular store on a given date.
